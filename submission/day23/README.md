# Task-01

### Create a agent for your app. ( which you deployed from docker in earlier task)

1. Access your Jenkins dashboard through a web browser.
2. Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" and then select "Manage Nodes and Clouds." In this section, you'll be able to create a new agent for your Jenkins setup.

7. Select the suitable launch method. For simplicity, you can opt for "Launch agent by connecting it to the master."
8. Save the Configuration: Click "Save" to finalize the new agent setup.

### Create a new Jenkins freestyle project for your app.

1. We will be using [React Django App](https://github.com/paragpallavsingh/react_django_demo_app) for this.
2. Login to Jenkins: Access your Jenkins dashboard using a web browser.
3. Create a New Project: Click on "New Item" to create a new project.
4. Choose Project Type: Select "Freestyle project" as the project type and provide a name for your project.
5. Configure Source Code Management: In the project configuration, specify details like the source code repository URL and the branch to build.
6. Define Build Steps: Under the "Build" section, add build steps such as executing shell commands or running scripts required for your project.
```
 docker build . -t django-app
 docker run -d -p 8001:8001 django-app:latest
```
7. Save and Build: Click "Save" to create the project. You can manually trigger builds using the "Build Now" button.

Running on port 8001. [**Make sure your port is defined in inbound security rules which you are using for your app**]

# Task-02

### Create Jenkins project to run "docker-compose up -d" command to start the multiple containers defined in the compose file

After following all steps, all you need is to update the script a bit as given below

```
echo "code cloned"
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --no-deps --build web
echo "code deploy"
docker-compose down
```
### Set up a cleanup step in the Jenkins project to run "docker-compose down" command to stop and remove the containers defined in the compose file.

Since you will need to remove your container after this demo, I've added a `docker-compose down` command. Please make sure to remove this while trying and you don't your app to be down.
